edfaSeverityTable README
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This readme file describes the code generated by mib2c (using the MIBs
  for Dummies (MFD) configuration file). The code generated was
  generated specifically for the following SNMP table:

     edfaSeverityTable

  Your code will be called when the snmp agent receives requests for
  the edfaSeverityTable table.  The agent will start by looking for the right
  row in your existing data to operate on, if one exists.


  Configuration Variables
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  Some variables used for code generation may be set to affect the code
  generation. You may override these variables by setting them in the
  file defaults/table-edfaSeverityTable.m2d, and then re-running mib2c.

    m2c_table_settable (currently '1')
    --------------------------------------------------------
    This variable determines whether or not code is generated to support
    MIB object which have an access of read-write or read-create. The
    default is set based on whether or not the table contains writable
    objects, but can be over-ridden.

    Syntax: @eval $m2c_table_settable = 0@


    m2c_table_dependencies (currently '0')
    --------------------------------------------------------
    This variable determines whether or not code is generated to support
    checking dependencies between columns, rows or tables. The default
    is set based on whether or not the table contains writable objects,
    but can be over-ridden.

    Syntax: @eval $m2c_table_dependencies = 0@


    m2c_table_row_creation (currently '0')
    --------------------------------------------------------
    This variable determines whether or not code is generated to support
    checking creation of new rows via SNMP. The default is set based on
    whether or not the table contains read-create objects, but can be
    over-ridden.

    Syntax: @eval $m2c_table_row_creation = 0@


    m2c_context_reg (currently 'netsnmp_data_list')
    --------------------------------------------------------
    This variable contains the structure name to typedef for the
    edfaSeverityTable_registration.

    During initilization, you will provide a pointer to a structure of
    this type. This pointer is used as a parameter to many functions so
    that you have access to your registration data. The default is a
    netsnmp_data_list pointer, which will allow you to keep multiple
    pointers tagged by a text name. If you have a new or existing structure
    you would rather use, you can redefine this variable.
    

    To avoid regenerating code, you may also change this typedef directly
    in the edfaSeverityTable.h header.

    Syntax: @eval $m2c_context_reg = "struct my_registration_context@


    m2c_data_context (currently 'generated')
    --------------------------------------------------------
    This variable contains the structure name to typedef for the
    edfaSeverityTable_data.

    This typedef is used in the row request context structure for the table,
    edfaSeverityTable_rowreq_ctx.

    The typedef in the primary table context will be used for the data and
    undo structure types. This structure should contain all the data
    needed for all the columns in the table. The default is 'generated',
    which will cuase a new data strcuture to be generated with data members
    for each column.

    To avoid regenerating code, you may also change this typedef directly
    in the edfaSeverityTable.h header.

    Syntax: @eval $m2c_data_context = "struct my_data_context"@


    m2c_data_allocate (currently '0')
    --------------------------------------------------------
    This variable determines whether or not the data context (see above)
    requires memory to be allocated. The default generated data structure
    does not. If you are using a custom data context which needs to
    allocate memory, override this value and two additional functions
    will be generated:

      edfaSeverityTable_allocate_data
      edfaSeverityTable_release_data

    Syntax: @eval $m2c_data_allocate = 1@


    m2c_data_init (currently '1')
    --------------------------------------------------------
    This variable determines whether or not the data context (see above)
    or any other items you have added to the table context requires
    initialization. The default generated data structure does not. If you
    are using a custom data context or have added items needing initialization
    to the table context, override this value and two additional functions
    will be generated:

      edfaSeverityTable_rowreq_ctx_init
      edfaSeverityTable_rowreq_ctx_cleanup

    Syntax: @eval 1 = 1@


    m2c_table_access (currently 'container-cached')
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    This variable determines which data interface will be use to generate
    code for looking up data for a given index. The default is the
    'container-cached' access code, which caches the data in a netsnmp-
    container (usually a sorted array).

    Available options can be determined by checking for mib2c configuration
    files that begin with 'mfd-access-*'.

    Syntax: @eval $m2c_table_access = 'container-cached'@

 
    m2c_include_examples (currently '1')
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    This variable determines whether or not to generate example code. The
    default is to generate example code.

    Syntax: @eval $m2c_include_examples = 0@


    m2c_data_transient (currently '2')
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    This variable determines how the generated example code deals with the
    data during data lookup. See the table readme file for details on how
    the current table access method interprets this value. In general,
    a value of 0 indicates persistent data, 1 indicates semi-transient and
    2 indicates transient data.

    Syntax: @eval $m2c_data_transient = 0@


 Index(es) for the edfaSeverityTable table
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  The index(es) for the edfaSeverityTable table are:

     edfaSeverityIndex:
        Syntax:      INTEGER32
        DataType:    INTEGER32
        ASN type:    ASN_INTEGER
        C-code type: long

  You should know how to set all these values from your data context,
  edfaSeverityTable_data.


************************************************************************
edfaSeverityTable File Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Several files have been generated to implement the edfaSeverityTable
  table. We'll go through these files, one by one, explaining each and
  letting you know which you need to edit.


File: edfaSeverityTable_data_access.[c|h]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The edfaSeverityTable_data_access file contains the interface to your data in
  its raw format.  These functions are used to build the row cache or 
  locate the row (depending on the table access method).

  Set MIB context
  -----------------
  TODO : Set MIB index values
  FUNC : edfaSeverityTable_indexes_set
  WHERE: edfaSeverityTable_data_access.c

  This is a convenience function for setting the index context from
  the native C data. Where necessary, value mapping should be done.

  This function should update the table index values (found in
  tbl_idx) for the given raw data.

  
  container summary
  ------------------------
    The container data access code is for cases when you want to
    store your data in the agent/sub-agent.

    ... to be continued...


  cache summary
  ------------------------
    The container-cached data access code is for cases when you want to
    cache your data in the agent/sub-agent.

    ... to be continued...




File: edfaSeverityTable_enums.h
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This file contains macros for mapping enumeration values when the
  enumerated values defined by the MIB do not match the values used
  internally.

  Review this file to see if any values need to be updated.


File: edfaSeverityTable_data_get.c
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Get data for column
  -------------------
  TODO : retrieve column data from raw data
  FUNC : edfaSeverityAmpStatus_get

  Get data for column
  -------------------
  TODO : retrieve column data from raw data
  FUNC : edfaSeverityInputPower_get

  Get data for column
  -------------------
  TODO : retrieve column data from raw data
  FUNC : edfaSeverityLop_get

  Get data for column
  -------------------
  TODO : retrieve column data from raw data
  FUNC : edfaSeverityLos_get

  Get data for column
  -------------------
  TODO : retrieve column data from raw data
  FUNC : edfaSeverityOutputPower_get

  Get data for column
  -------------------
  TODO : retrieve column data from raw data
  FUNC : edfaSeverityTemperature_get



File: edfaSeverityTable_data_set.c
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This code was generated based on the following assumptions or settings:

  1) Some of the values for this table have DEPENDENCIES on other objects.

  DEPENDENCIES on other objects complicates SET request processing. When
  one or more columns in a table depend on another object (in the same
  table, or in another table), a DEPENDENCY exists. For example, if you
  have a table that determine a color with three columns (red, green and
  blue) that define the percentage of each primary color, the total for
  the three columns must equal 100 percent. So, in addition to checking
  that each colums has a valid value between 0 and 100, the total of
  all three columns must equal 100.

  Set $m2c_table_dependencies = 0 in defaults/table-edfaSeverityTable.m2d
  and regenerate code if this assumption is incorrect.

  2) This table does not support ROW CREATION.

  Supporting ROW CREATION allows new rows to be created via SNMP requests.



  Undo setup
  ----------
  TODO : save data for undo
  FUNC : edfaSeverityTable_undo_setup

  This function will be called before the individual undo_setup functions are
  called. This is where you should save any undo information which is not
  directly related to a particular column. This function will only be called
  once per row. After this function is called, any column which is being
  set will have its individual node undo_setup function called.

  ----------------------
  TODO : perform additional validations on values for a set request
  FUNC : edfaSeverityAmpStatus_check_value

  The generated code will automatically validate incoming requests against
  all the requirements specified by the syntax of the MIB. However, it is
  often the case that additional requirements are specified in the
  description of a MIB object. Those type of validations should be checked
  in this function.

edfaSeverityTable Reference
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Function flow
----------------------------------------------------
To give you the general idea of how the functions flow works, this
example flow is from a complete table implementation.

NOTE: Depending on your configuration, some of the functions used in the
      examples below  may not have been generated for the
      edfaSeverityTable table.

      Conversely, the examples below may not include some functions that
      were generated for the edfaSeverityTable table.

To watch the flow of the edfaSeverityTable table, use the
following debug tokens:

        snmp_agent
        helper:table:req
        edfaSeverityTable
        verbose:edfaSeverityTable
        internal:edfaSeverityTable
